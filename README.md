# Euler's Method for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)

Euler's method is a simple numerical technique for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) numerically. It's particularly useful for first-order ODEs and serves as the foundation for more sophisticated numerical methods. Here's how it works:

## Problem Statement

Given a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the form:
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y)$$
with an initial condition $y(x_0) = y_0$, we want to find the approximate solution $y(x)$ over a specified interval.

## Euler's Method

Euler's method approximates the solution to the ODE by performing successive linear approximations based on the derivative of the function $ f(x, y) $. Here's the iterative process:

1. **Initial Condition**: Start with the initial condition $y(x_0) = y_0$.
2. **Step Size**: Choose a small step size $h$ that determines the distance between consecutive points along the $x$-axis.
3. **Iteration**: For each step $i$:
   - Calculate the slope $f(x_i, y_i)$ at the current point $(x_i, y_i)$.
   - Use the slope to approximate the change in $y$ over the interval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$:
     $$\Delta y = f(x_i, y_i) \cdot h$$
   - Update the values of $x$ and $y$ for the next iteration:
     $$x_{i+1} = x_i + h$$
     $$y_{i+1} = y_i + \Delta y$$
4. **Repeat**: Repeat the process until the desired endpoint is reached.

## Accuracy and Stability

Euler's method is a first-order method, meaning its error decreases linearly with the step size $h$. While it's simple and easy to implement, it can suffer from stability issues and accumulate error over long intervals or when dealing with stiff ODEs. To mitigate these issues, smaller step sizes are often used, but this comes at the cost of increased computational effort.
